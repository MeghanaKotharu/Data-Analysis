I finished my project and learnt the following:
1. Descriptive statistics
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Using formulas
4. Conditional formatting(graphs, manage rules,new rules)
5. Pivot tables, pivot graphs(slicers,filters)
6. Measures(inside pivot and click add data to data model)
7. Top n/bottom n
8. Anamoly detection(using graphs-box plot(in histogram))
9. Combine tables(x- & v-lookup)

Now, It's time to implement all of these into our new project and learn a lot of things.
