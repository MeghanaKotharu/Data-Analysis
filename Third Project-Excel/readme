" Mobile data Analysis"

The dataset contains the different types of products and their features and helps customers in finding which mobile phone suits their needs and provides them with the best phone possible

1. DataSet Collection:
I used web scraping method to collect the dataset from a website, the tool i used here is **Instant Data Scrapper** 

2.I need to perfom cleaning of the data and transform it into required manner by cleaning anamolies, null values, duplicate values etc.

I know i have been MIA since few days and i haven't uploaded my progress here. That's because i have a lot of issues while working on the project and my laptop is not so easy to work with.
Anyway, I finished the data cleaning which took alot of time for me due to the web scraping. 
I used the Power pivot, Conditional Formating, Basic Formulas, Filters, Data Validation and various techniques to perform the cleaning.
I completed the data analysis as well for which i used various functions like Countif, CountA, VLookup, Match & Find, Data validation for the filters, Pivot Tables, Slicers etc.

I will complete the Data Visualisation as well so that i can finsih off this Project.
