For whoever reading this(Even if it is me), HI!
Hope you are having a good day so far!

So this is My First Official Power BI project. 

I know it is not a big one, Baby steps right!, so i decided to choose a dataset that has many anomalies but not too much advanced that i wont be able to handle.
How and where did i get the dataset?
I searched various places like kaggle, Github(Mostly), dataset reference videos from Youtube etc. I finally found thi dataset and felt like it could be a good start.

I will be working on the file(Will start now) and I will update my progress in this readme as much as possible

Im learning this on my own and Im following a project based approach and parlallely Im study theoritical parts to understand the concepts.

Gotta go and start the project!

Bye!
