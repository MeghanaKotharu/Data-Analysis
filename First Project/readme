For whoever reading this(Even if it is me), HI!
Hope you are having a good day so far!

So this is My First Official Power BI project. 

I know it is not a big one, Baby steps right!, so i decided to choose a dataset that has many anomalies but not too much advanced that i wont be able to handle.
How and where did i get the dataset?
I searched various places like kaggle, Github(Mostly), dataset reference videos from Youtube etc. I finally found thi dataset and felt like it could be a good start.

I will be working on the file(Will start now) and I will update my progress in this readme as much as possible

Im learning this on my own and Im following a project based approach and parlallely Im study theoritical parts to understand the concepts.

Gotta go and start the project!

Bye!

I finished my project successfullyüòÅ

It was really good experience and i learnt a lot through this.
Things i used while doing the project.
1. Collecting Data and Loading it into Power BI
2. Preprocessing data(Transform): Removing Columns,Removing NULL values, Replacing values Splitting columns, Changing data types, Identifying error rows and dealing with them etc.
3. Merge: Adding Custom columns and alot more.
4. I have also learnt Data Visualisations Basics like Adding Cards, Text Boxes, Using slicers, Charts, Bar Graphs etc.

I will continue to learn more projects and improve my learnings, and will also learn theory on side.

Thanks.
Have Fun!
